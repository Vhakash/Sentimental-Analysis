# Sentimental-Analysis
A simple Sentiment Analysis project that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and classify text data based on sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).

Project Overview
This project uses machine learning algorithms to perform sentiment analysis on a given text dataset. By training a model on labeled data, it can determine whether a given text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The project demonstrates the application of NLP for sentiment classification, which can be used in various domains, including social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and review mining.
